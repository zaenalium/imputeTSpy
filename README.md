# imputeTSpy: Time series Imputation in Python

## What is it?

This package is a package for all imputation method in time series method. Most of this kind of package are available in R, however, when we use the package for interfacing python to R is somehow complicated, and need to install a lot of things as well as the performance is doesn't meet our expectation. Thefore, I decide to create this dedicated python package for time series imputation.
